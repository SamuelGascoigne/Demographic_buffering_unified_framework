Here we outline the code linked to our manuscript _A unified framework to  quantify demographic buffering in natural populations_ - see the associated preprint here [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) [here]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.03.547528v1.abstract)). Each script linked to a figure (_e.g._ Figure 1.R) is completely reproducible.
