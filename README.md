# Demographic buffering unified framework

Here we outline the code linked to our manuscript _A unified framework to  quantify demographic buffering in natural populations_ - see the associated preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.03.547528v1.abstract). Each script linked to a figure (_e.g._ Figure 1.R) is completely reproducible.
